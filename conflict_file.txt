This is the file on Sulochana's git that all team members will edit to crate a conflict per the assignment.

Type the team contact email here: siri.lerdsirisopon@gmail.com 
(Each of us types in our own email address to create a conflict)

This is sulochana
my email id is :akki.sulochana@gmail.com

please share all your mail ids.

This is Siri again... Adding this line after pulling the changes from Sulochana's git on GitHub. 
After pulling, the branches merged and somehow, Sulochana's added lines 
(from "This is sulochana" above to "please share all your mail ids") 
is automatically concatenated to the existing conflict_file.txt on my local repo.
